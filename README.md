# Simple Contact Form Plugin
A WordPress plugin that lets users add a contact form to any page or post using a shortcode. The form will collect basic information like name, email, and message, and also store the data in the database as well as send an email notification. 

#### How to Use
- Go to [tags](https://github.com/frankremmy/simple-contact-form/tags) and download the latest version.
- Install and activate the [plugin](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/#aioseo-install-a-plugin-using-the-wordpress-admin-plugin-upload) (use a dev environment for now since it's currently on development).
- Add the contact form on a page or post using the shortcode [simple_contact_form].

To know more about the features of the version you installed, read its [release note](https://github.com/frankremmy/simple-contact-form/releases).
